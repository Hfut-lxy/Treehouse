## Reporting a bug

Please include the following in bug reports:

- steps required to reproduce the bug
- expected vs actual behavior
- versions of:
 - RoboViz (ideally the commit SHA)
 - the JDK
 - the OS (Ubuntu 14.04, Windows 7...)
 - the graphics hardware (for rendering-related bugs - this info is printed to the console when RoboViz starts)

## Contributing code

Pull requests should be directed to the dev branch - the master branch should be in sync with the latest release.

The repository includes an Eclipse source formatter file ([`source_format.xml`](https://github.com/Gama11/RoboViz/blob/master/source_format.xml)), be sure to use it to format your code. Eclipse's "Organize Imports" feature should also be used. Both of these can be configured to run each time a source file is saved.
